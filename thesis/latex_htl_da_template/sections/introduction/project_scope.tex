\section{Project Scope}

\subsection{System Constraints}

\subsubsection{Low-Cost Design}

The main constraint of the project is cost. The system should be significantly cheaper than existing automatic scoring solutions and therefore relies only on off-the-shelf consumer hardware. The software must run on commonly available devices such as a Raspberry Pi or a basic home computer without requiring specialized processing units.

The setup should also be practical for private users. Ideally, it can be assembled using everyday household items and a standard webcam that users may already own, avoiding the need for custom-built mounting structures or proprietary equipment.

\subsubsection{Single-Camera Setup}

To further reduce cost and installation effort, the system uses only a single camera. This creates a computer vision challenge because a three-dimensional dart impact must be interpreted from a two-dimensional image. The camera position therefore has to be selected carefully so the board remains fully visible and dart occlusions are minimized.

This restriction defines the technical focus of the thesis: determining which reliable information can be extracted from a single video stream in order to identify dart hits and calculate scores.
