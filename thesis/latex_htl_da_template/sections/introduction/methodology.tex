\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Iterative Development Approach}
\subsubsection{Prototype-Based Experimentation}
The development will follow an agile, prototype-driven methodology. Initial work will focus on creating a minimal viable prototype for the vision subsystem to test core assumptions about camera perspective and dart detectability. Simultaneously, a prototype for the web interface will be developed to validate the user experience and game logic.

\subsubsection{Evaluation and Refinement Cycles}
The project will proceed in iterative cycles of implementation, testing, and refinement. Each component—vision, game logic, and user interface—will be evaluated against the defined requirements. Feedback from these evaluations will directly inform subsequent development phases, ensuring that the final system is both robust and user-friendly, aligning with the milestones set forth in the project timeline.
