abstract = {We propose a flexible new technique to easily calibrate a camera. It only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one more step from laboratory environments to real world use. The corresponding software is available from the author's Web page. {\textcopyright} 2000 IEEE.},

@article{Schwingshackl2010,
abstract = {The reliance of the aerospace industry on finite element models during the design of new products requires the best possible models for the prediction of the dynamic behaviour and so it is usually necessary to validate an original model using some additional reference data as the basis-usually data measured on a test structure. Finite element model updating can lead to the required accuracy, and while attempts are under way to minimise the required experimental testing involved in the process, measurements still are an integral part of the procedure. To improve the validation process, a major aim of current experimental research is to provide a more complete set of data from a single experiment in a shorter amount of time, so as to increase the overall efficiency of the updating routine. To this end, a new continuously scanning laser Doppler vibrometery measurement technique is presented for application to cylindrical structures. It allows the measurement of the dynamic behaviour of a cylindrical structure with a previously unachievable spatial resolution in a much shorter time than conventional measurement methods. The introduced method is evaluated through a detailed simulation in order to investigate its robustness and to ensure data quality, and the results from a proof-of-concept test rig are presented. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper shows that it is possible to use genetic algorithms to optimize the layout of ferrite tile absorber in a partially lined screened enclosure to produce a "best" performance. The enclosure and absorber are modeled using TLM modeling techniques and the performance is determined by comparison with theoretical normalized site attenuation of free space. The results show that it is possible to cover just 80% of the surface of the enclosure with ferrite absorber and obtain a response which is within ±4 dB of the free space response between 40 and 200 MHz.},

@article{Osadchy2006,
abstract = {In this paper we discuss object detection when only a small number of training examples are given. Specifically, we show how to incorporate a simple prior on the distribution of natural images into support vector machines. SVMs are known to be robust to overfitting; however, a few training examples usually do not represent well the structure of the class. Thus the resulting detectors are not robust and highly depend on the choice of the training examples. We incorporate the prior on natural images by requiring that the separating hyperplane will not only yield a wide margin, but also that the corresponding positive half space will have a low probability to contain natural images (the background). Our experiments on real data sets show that the resulting detector is more robust to the choice of training examples, and substantially improves both linear and kernel SVM when trained on 10 positive and 10 negative examples. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

@article{Canny1986,
abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of theso-lution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for severalcom-mon image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle be-tween detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient mag-nitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature syn-thesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector perfor-mance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge. This detection scheme uses several elongated operators at each point, and the directional operator outputs are in-tegrated with the gradient maximum detector. {\textcopyright} 1986 IEEE},

@article{Gustafsson2014,
abstract = {In this study we revisit the problem of computing steady Navier-Stokes flows in two-dimensional unbounded domains. Precise quantitative characterization of such flows in the high-Reynolds number limit remains an open problem of theoretical fluid dynamics. Following a review of key mathematical properties of such solutions related to the slow decay of the velocity field at large distances from the obstacle, we develop and carefully validate a spectrally-accurate computational approach which ensures the correct behavior of the solution at infinity. In the proposed method the numerical solution is defined on the entire unbounded domain without the need to truncate this domain to a finite box with some artificial boundary conditions prescribed at its boundaries. Since our approach relies on the streamfunction-vorticity formulation, the main complication is the presence of a discontinuity in the streamfunction field at infinity which is related to the slow decay of this field. We demonstrate how this difficulty can be overcome by reformulating the problem using a suitable background "skeleton" field expressed in terms of the corresponding Oseen flow combined with spectral filtering. The method is thoroughly validated for Reynolds numbers spanning two orders of magnitude with the results comparing favourably against known theoretical predictions and the data available in the literature.},
